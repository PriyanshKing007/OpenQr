## üöÄ Quick start

Use it online:
- Open the live app: https://proqr.wuaze.com
- No sign-up needed. Everything runs locally in your browser.

Run locally (pick one):
1) Static (no build tools)
- Clone or download this repo
- Open index.html in a modern browser
- For camera/scanner to work locally, serve over http(s). Example:
  - Using Node: npx serve .
  - VS Code: Live Server extension

2) With Node (if package.json is present)
- Install: npm install
- Dev server: npm run dev
- Build: npm run build
- Preview: npm run preview

Self-host
- Any static host works: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, Nginx, Apache, etc.
- Ensure the site is served over HTTPS so the camera API is available for scanning.

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Usage

Generate a QR
1) Pick a mode: UPI or Link
2) Fill in the fields (e.g., UPI VPA, amount, name; or a website URL)
3) Customize colors, size, and add a logo (optional)
4) Preview updates in real time
5) Save to history (add a note if you like), Download (PNG/SVG), Print, or Share

Scan a QR
- Open the built-in scanner
- Grant camera permission
- Point your camera at any QR to decode it instantly
- Copy/open the result, or save it to your history

History management
- Every saved QR stores details, notes, and timestamps
- Search, filter, and reuse entries
- Backup or migrate with Import/Export (JSON)

Tips for reliable scanning
- Keep embedded logos small and high-contrast
- Use clear colors with good contrast from the background
- Print at sufficient size if you expect distant scanning

Note on UPI
- UPI is India‚Äôs Unified Payments Interface. When scanned, UPI QRs open the payer‚Äôs UPI-enabled app. Always verify the payee VPA before making payments.

## üîê Privacy

- 100% client-side. No servers, no database, and no analytics are required for core features.
- Your history and settings are stored in your browser (on-device).
- Nothing leaves your device unless you explicitly share or export it.

## üíª Browser support

- Works best on modern, evergreen browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
- Camera access (for the scanner) requires HTTPS and user permission.
- iOS Safari may prompt for camera permission per session.
